<p>Welcome to the fossil facility, a place to learn about the many exiting types of fossils and how they were formed.<img src="Fossil Facility logo.png" alt="" width="362" height="258" class="padding" align="left"/></p>
<hr>
<p>When most people think of fossils,  they immediately picture the enormous skull of a Tyrannosaurus Rex or the  skeletal wings of a Pterodactyl.</p>
<p>However, there are many types of fossils in  the world, ranging from insects in amber to petrified trees.</p>
<p>These are only a  few of the countless fossils in the world that more people should know about.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><u>Most fossilized creatures fall into  three major kingdoms, Kingdom Protozoa, Kingdom Animalia, and Kingdom Plantae.</u></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Kingdom  Protozoa contains single celled organisms such as Nummulites.</li>
  <li>Kingdom  Animalia is a far broader classification, containing any type of animal from  fish to dinosaurs.</li>
  <li>Kingdom  Plantae contains all types of plants.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>However, before learning to classify fossils, it is important to learn what kinds of fossils their are and how they are formed. Some famous types of fossils are Trace fossils, Molds and Casts, and Permineralization.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Trace Fossils: Fossilised materials that show activities that occured in the past, rather than the remains of fossilised creatures. Trace fossils include things like dinosaur tracks, burrows, egg shells, and tooth marks.</li>
  <li>Molds and Casts: A Mold is an indention in the shape of a creature and a Cast is a copy of the organism that made the Mold. When an organism buried in sediment decays, it may leave behind an indention in the dirt that is the same shape as itself, this is how a Mold forms. When a mold fills with more sediment and that sediment hardens into the shape of the Mold, it becomes a Cast.</li>
  <li>Permineralization: Permineralization occurs when minerals permeate porous tissue like wood or bone, and then fill in all the empty spaces. This is the most commonly known type of fossilization.</li>
</ul>
